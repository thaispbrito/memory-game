// PSEUDOCODE (Initial Project Planning) - Concentration (Memory Game)

//1. First, define the variables that are required for tracking the state of the game, 
// such as a variable that tracks the number of tries and another one that tracks the numbers of pairs, among others.

//2. Think about how you want to define the number of pairs. It could be predefined by the game, set by the user or 
// incremented by different levels of the game.

//3. Make sure to store the cached element references.

//4. The state of the game should be initialized when the page loads.

//5. A function should be called to render the state of the game, and that state should be rendered to the user.

//6. Define any required constants for the game.

//7. Create all the necessary functions, including one to handle a player clicking a pair element (e.g., card).
// This `handleClick` function should call other functions defined in the global scope.

//8. Create a reset functionality, so that the game could restart once triggered by a click from the user.

//9. Add event listeners to handle user interactions, at least for the pair elements and for the reset button.

//10. Define how the player loses the game. It could be after a certain amount of time or a certain number of wrong guesses.

//11. Define a theme for you game, such as Nature/hiking related. The pairs could be represented by cards, symbols, emojis, pictures, etc.
